The special requirements of academic organizations, particularly those with health centers, present some unique considerations that can confound this important and difficult process. Typically, national searches attract a sizable candidate list composed of persons with diverse backgrounds and experiences, and a committee is empowered to sort through their qualifications. A critical step in the planning of each search is the development of a process that allows participatory decision making while not requiring too much time. Too often the search becomes an unmanageable activity that confuses the searchers and frustrates the administration. A seven-step process has proven successful for use by committees to attract and sort through written candidate applications, to agree upon a preliminary ranking of candidates and to reach a consensus on a final list of recommendations. The process could be applied in almost any organizational setting.",[],3514907v1,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5432a99cdd9f8b248c50274cd3d2a6016f3d081e,['Medline'],Organizing a search for an academic administrator.,The Journal of reproductive medicine,1986

FPR is the founding member of a subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors thought to function in inflammatory processes. The other two members, FPR-like (FPRL)1 and FPRL2, have a greatly reduced affinity for bacterial peptides or do not bind them at all, with FPRL2 being considered an orphan receptor so far. In this study we show that a peptide derived from the N-terminal domain of the anti-inflammatory protein annexin 1 (lipocortin 1) can activate all three FPR family members at similar concentrations. The annexin 1 peptide initiates chemotactic responses in human monocytes that express all three FPR family members and also desensitizes the cells toward subsequent stimulation with bacterial peptide agonists. Experiments using HEK 293 cells stably expressing a single FPR family member reveal that all three receptors can be activated and desensitized by the N-terminal annexin 1 peptide. These observations identify the annexin 1 peptide as the first endogenous ligand of FPRL2 and indicate that annexin 1 participates in regulating leukocyte emigration into inflamed tissue by activating and desensitizing different receptors of the FPR family.","['http://www.jimmunol.org/content/jimmunol/172/12/7669.full.pdf', 'http://www.jimmunol.org/content/172/12/7669.full.pdf']",15187149v1,http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/cb73/147dc0bf1b2eabc5513c5e7952ef4f36df16.pdf,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/155663331ea93379e99997bd43340eb54ab41a73,['Medline'],An annexin 1 N-terminal peptide activates leukocytes by triggering different members of the formyl peptide receptor family.,Journal of immunology,2004

It has been reported that sera from patients with interstitial pneumonia show elevated level of CA 19-9. To investigate the relationship between the elevation of serum CA 19-9 (sCA 19-9) and the presence of pulmonary fibrosis, we examined the level of sCA 19-9 in sera from patients with rheumatic diseases with or without interstitial pneumonia (IP). The sCA 19-9 level was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Fourteen sera of 129 (10.9%) patients with rheumatic diseases without malignant disorders were positive for sCA 19-9 when normal range was determined as less than 100 U/ml (mean +/- 5 SD), and 26.7% of sera from poly/dermatomyositis (PM/DM) and 11.8% of systemic sclerosis (PSS) were positive for CA 19-9. Whereas only 8.0% of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was positive. Twelve (28.6%) of 42 rheumatic patients with IP showed positive levels for sCA 19-9 (mean 142.5 +/- 363.0 U/ml), whereas only two (2.3%) of 87 without IP were positive (mean 33.9 +/- 65.8 U/ml; p < 0.05). The correlation between the level of sCA 19-9 and pulmonary diffusing capacity (%DLCO) revealed an inverse correlation in 32 rheumatic patients with IP (r = -0.43, p < 0.05). Furthermore, the elevated sCA 19-9 levels decreased after treatment with corticosteroid and/or cyclophosphamide or cyclosporin A. Therefore, elevation of the level of sCA 19-9 seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of IP and sCA 19-9 will be a useful parameter for IP. It has been reported that the CA 19-9 is produced from the bronchial glands and suggested that during chronic fibrotic process of the lung, the metaplastic change of the bronchial glandular cells occur and the cells produce CA 19-9.",[],8705689v1,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b5a25960ebee9a6e5db79196e6b07f0edfcf5313,['Medline'],[Serum CA 19-9 levels in rheumatic diseases with interstitial pneumonia].,Nihon Rinsho Men'eki Gakkai kaishi = Japanese journal of clinical immunology,1996

The Schottky pair is another dominant defect with a cost of 1.51 eV per defect site from S-rich to Ca-rich chemical potential limits. Our calculations on the thermodynamic transition levels confirm the experimental observed intrinsic blue two-peak broad band emissions stimulated by near-infrared range irradiation for undoped CaS. Both Eu and Dy show an energetic favorable trend to be substitutionally doped in the CaS lattice. All of the positive charge states of the Eu ion contribute localized recombination trapping level in the gap while having very deep donor transition levels. The neutral state of Dy contributes to the occupied 4f level localized 1.3 eV below the conduction band edge with very shallow donor type transition level (0/+) of 0.56 eV below the conduction band. All of the positive charge states of Dy have two shallow 5d levels with 0.4 and 0.6 eV below the conduction band. In this work, we further analyzed that the Dy dopant contributed deeper trap levels in the CaS materials that can store the electron carriers with more evenly, wider, and deeper range of levels distributed so that they lengthen the decay-time of the persistent luminescence.

Supplementum,Jan-37,566,[],"The influences of induced alterations in muscle perfusion pressure on the physiological responses to rhythmic exercise in man were investigated. The experiments were carried out in healthy subjects performing leg exercise on a cycle ergometer at light to exhaustive work intensities. Increased muscle perfusion pressure was brought about by exposing the working legs of the supine subject to a subatmospheric pressure of -50 mm Hg (Lower Body Negative Pressure, LBNP), decreased perfusion pressure by instead applying a supraatmospheric pressure of 50 mm Hg (Leg Positive Pressure, LPP). In this way, the perfusion pressure in dynamically exercising large muscle groups could be altered in a controlled fashion. The influences of such manipulation of the perfusion pressure on the physiological adjustments to incremental-load exercise were studied and analysed. The main results and conclusions were as follows: (1) Exercise-induced increases in cardiac output were attenuated by LBNP, an effect caused by curtailment of stroke volume secondary to suction-induced sequestration of blood volume in capacitance vessels not affected by the action of the leg muscle pump. This situation resembles that of dynamic leg exercise in the upright body position. Thus, supine exercise with LBNP at -50 mm Hg seems to be a valid model of upright leg exercise, not only in that it increases perfusion pressure in working muscles but also by causing similar changes in the central circulation as a shift from supine to upright leg exercise. (2) Exercise-induced increases in systolic arterial pressure were markedly exaggerated by LPP, an effect attributable to increased exercise responses in both cardiac output and total peripheral resistance. The exaggerated pressor response supports the notion of a muscle chemoreflex drive in response to flow-restricted exercise tending to reduce the existing flow error. (3) Exercise-induced increases in O2 uptake and blood lactate concentration were both attenuated by LBNP and exaggerated by LPP. The changes in blood lactate levels are attributable to perfusion-pressure dependent variations in muscle blood flow, resulting in opposite changes in the share contributed by anaerobic metabolism to the energy release. Possible explanations for the fact that impaired muscle perfusion was associated with increased O2 uptake at given external work loads are discussed. (4) Exercise-induced responses of the pulmonary ventilation were attenuated by LBNP and markedly exaggerated by LPP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",[],3480686v1,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3abe524586ee28ac2f4622493a590b898e4ea16c,['Medline'],Responses to dynamic leg exercise in man as influenced by changes in muscle perfusion pressure.,Acta physiologica Scandinavica.

In this study, neuroprotective effects of leonurine against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions in cortex were evaluated. We used transient rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of brain ischemia. The rats were treated with their respective treatments for 1 week prior to the MCAO. We found that leonurine significantly improved neurological outcome and reduced ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced cerebral infarction 24 h after MCAO. Leonurine decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in mitochondria isolated from ischemic cortex, which was increased by MCAO. Terminal deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) staining showed anti-apoptotic effect of leonurine on ischemic cortex. Western blot analysis showed a marked decrease in the expression of Bax and an increase of Bcl-2 as a result of leonurine treatment. The attenuation of mitochondrial membrane swelling, restore of mitochondrial membrane potential and content of cytochrome c (Cyt-C) in mitochondria isolated from ischemic cortex could also be observed in leonurine treated group.

Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is the second most common primary hepatic tumor in Germany, with about 3500 new cases per year. In recent years, its prognosis has improved because of wider resections and the establishment of local treatment and chemotherapy in the palliative situation.


METHODS
This review is based on pertinent articles that were retrieved by a selective literature search in the PubMed database with the keywords ""cholangiocarcinoma AND diagnostic OR therapy."" Articles in English or German published up to January 2014 were considered.


RESULTS
The sole curative treatment for CCA is surgery, but 40-85% of all patients have recurrent disease even after radical excision. Because of this high recurrence rate, adjuvant treatments are now under intense discussion. For unresectable CCA without distant metastases, small case series have shown that liver transplantation can yield promising survival rates of over 50% at 5 years. For many patients with CCA, however, only palliative treatments can be offered, including endoscopic clearing of the biliary pathways. Because of the low prevalence of the disease, there have been only a few phase 3 studies of palliative chemotherapy for CCA. On the basis of one positive phase 3 study, chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin is considered the standard and now plays an established role in palliative care.


CONCLUSION
CCA presents a special challenge in gastroenterology, oncology, and visceral surgery because of the difficulty in establishing the diagnosis, local complications in the biliary pathways, and a high recurrence rate after resection. Future studies should address not only the role of adjuvant chemotherapy, but also the efficacy of combined local and systemic treatment.",[],25412632v1,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3c8e5aba200ca4846ee5955c00df33460aa31eff,['Medline'],The diagnosis and treatment of cholangiocarcinoma.,Deutsches Arzteblatt international,2014

However, because CXCR3 equivalently binds four different ELR-devoid CXC chemokines (ie, PF4/CXCL4, IP-10/CXCL10, MIG/CXCL9, and IP-9/CXCL11), we sought to identify the ligand that coordinates epidermal coverage with the maturation of the underlying superficial dermis. Because CXCL11 (IP-9 or I-TAC) is produced by redifferentiating keratinocytes late in the regenerative phase when re-epithelialization is completed and matrix maturation ensues, we generated mice in which an antisense construct (IP-9AS) eliminated IP-9 expression during the wound-healing process. Both full and partial thickness excisional wounds were created and analyzed histologically throughout a 2-month period. Wound healing was impaired in the IP-9AS mice, with a hypercellular and immature dermis noted even after 60 days. Re-epithelialization was delayed with a deficient delineating basement membrane persisting in mice expressing the IP-9AS construct. Provisional matrix components persisted in the dermis, and the mature basement membrane components laminin V and collagen IV were severely diminished. Interestingly, the inflammatory response was not diminished despite IP-9/I-TAC being chemotactic for such cells. We conclude that IP-9 is a key ligand in the CXCR3 signaling system for wound repair, promoting re-epithelialization and modulating the maturation of the superficial dermis.",[],18669615v1,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c38241f7b6f45c4456b62ca96272b55d583390cb,['Medline'],ELR-negative CXC chemokine CXCL11 (IP-9/I-TAC) facilitates dermal and epidermal maturation during wound repair.,The American journal of pathology,2008

[1] regarding antegrade selective cerebral perfusion (SCP) with lower body circulatory arrest (LBCA) at moderate body core temperatures of 30?????????32???C. We agree with the authors that antegrade SCP, utilizing deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (21?????????27???C) to safeguard the protection of the visceral end-organs and the spinal cord, has become the most efficient neuroprotective strategy during transverse aortic arch repair over the past decades. However, as described by the authors, antegrade SCP is being increasingly utilized in combination with progressively increasing body core temperatures [1], a trend culminating in the advocation of moderate-to-mild temperatures (up to 35???C) and even normothermia [2]. Suzuki et al. report on their technique of total aortic arch repair in a contemporary series of 105 patients using a quadrifurcated Dacron graft. The authors proclaim that they routinely aim for deeper body core temperatures (25???C) to ensure lower body-organ protection when LBCA is expected to exceed a duration of 30 min. However, the authors also state that in ?????????lmost all cases... the core temperature was still 30?????????32???C????????? with a mean LBCA time of 58 ??? 22 min in the reported series [1]. This progressive approach may bear potential risks for the non-perfused organs in case of prolonged operation times?????????pparently not only in case of unexpected technical problems (as documented by an average of 58 min of LBCA) [3, 4]. The authors also admit that they are not familiar with the safe limits of spinal cord ischaemic tolerance during distal circulatory arrest at mild hypothermia. In fact, the ischaemic tolerance of the spinal cord and the visceral organs has not yet been clearly defined, and is therefore not well recognized in clinical practice.

Human glutathione peroxidase disposed of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at a rate that was only 17% of the rate at which human catalase simultaneously removed hydrogen peroxide. The relative rates observed were in agreement with the relative rates predicted from the kinetic constants of the two enzymes. These results confirm two earlier studies on intact erythrocytes, which refuted the notion that glutathione peroxidase is the primary enzyme for removal of hydrogen peroxide within erythrocytes. The present findings differ from the results with intact cells, however, in showing that glutathione peroxidase accounts for even less than 50% of the removal of hydrogen peroxide. A means is proposed for calculating the relative contribution of glutathione peroxidase and catalase in other cells and species. The present results raise the possibility that the major function of glutathione peroxidase may be the disposal of organic peroxides rather than the removal of hydrogen peroxide.",['http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/bloodjournal/87/4/1595.full.pdf?sso-checked=true'],8608252v1,http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b8c1/21da4e5f99e9e36c27b94d84faef8d411dcb.pdf,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/18aa7c88584d3ea0c8f798d9b131cb35969b9e33,['Medline'],Predominant role of catalase in the disposal of hydrogen peroxide within human erythrocytes.,Blood,1996

In addition, epidermal keratinocytes have been the target of many studies because they respond to a rich variety of inflammatory and immunomodulating cytokines, hormones, vitamins, ultraviolet (UV) light, toxins, and physical injury. Because of the ethical considerations, the effects of harmful or dangerous agents on skin have been studied using artificial skin substitutes.

Perinatal function may be related, in part, to the patency or fusion of the vomeronasal and nasopalatine (NPD) ducts. However, few studies have focused on NPD development in primates, which generally have a prolonged period of dependence during infancy. In this study we examined 24 prenatal primates and 13 neonatal primates, and a comparative sample of fetal mice and insectivores. In embryonic and early fetal Microcebus murinus, the NPD was completely fused, whereas in fetuses of later stages the duct was partially fused or completely patent. M. myoxinus of all stages demonstrated some degree of NPD fusion. In all other prenatal primates, the NPD was fused to some extent. Four prenatal insectivores (Tenrec ecaudatus) showed some degree of NPD fusion. In Mus musculus at 19 days gestation, the NPD was patent, although the anatomically separate VNO duct was fused. T. ecaudatus and most of the neonatal primates revealed complete NPD patency. An exception was Saguinus geoffroyi, which exhibited fusion of the NPD near the VNO opening. These observations may relate to differences in perinatal VNO function. The differences noted in our study suggest that M. murinus and M. myoxinus may differ in perinatal VNO functionality and perhaps in related behavior. Observations of neonatal primates suggest that NPD patency may be relatively common at birth and could serve other purposes in addition to being an access route for VNO stimuli.",['http://srufaculty.sru.edu/timothy.smith/tds-web-pages/shimp-2003.pdf'],12923897v1,http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/eb3a/d31aace74a5c75a7093d5521a082be508b1d.pdf,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/eb3ad31aace74a5c75a7093d5521a082be508b1d,['Medline'],Ontogeny of the nasopalatine duct in primates.,"The anatomical record.

Lumbar disc prolapse is one of the common causes of low back pain seen in the working population. There are contradictorty reports regarding the clinical significance of various magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings observed in these patients. The study was conducted to correlate the abnormalities observed on MRI and clinical features of lumbar disc prolapse.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
119 clinically diagnosed patients with lumbar disc prolapse were included in the study. Clinical evaluation included pain distribution, neurological symptoms and signs. MR evaluation included grades of disc degeneration, type of herniation, neural foramen compromise, nerve root compression, and miscellaneous findings. These MRI findings were tested for inter- and intraobserver variability. The MRI findings were then correlated with clinical symptoms and the level of disc prolapse as well as neurological signs and symptoms. Statistical analysis included the Kappa coefficient, Odd's ratio, and logistic regression analysis.


RESULTS
There were no significant inter- or intraobserver variations for most of MRI findings (Kappa value more than 0.5) except for type of disc herniation which showed a interobserver variation of 0.46 (Kappa value). The clinical level of pain distribution correlated well with the MRI level (Kappa 0.8), but not all disc bulges produced symptoms. Central bulges and disc protrusions with thecal sac compression were mostly asymptomatic, while centrolateral protrusions and extrusions with neural foramen compromise correlated well with the dermatomal distribution of pain. Root compression observed in MRI did not produce neurological symptoms or deficits in all patients but when deficits were present, they correlated well with the presence of root compression in MRI. Multiple level disc herniations with foramen compromise were strongly associated with the presence of neurological signs.


CONCLUSIONS
The presence of centrolateral protrusion or extrusion with gross foramen compromise correlates with clinical signs and symptoms very well, while central bulges and disc protrusions correlate poorly with clinical signs and symptoms. The presence of neural foramen compromise is more important in determining the clinical signs and symptoms while type of disc herniation (bulge, protrusion, or extrusion) correlates poorly with clinical signs and symptoms.",[],20697478v1,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bba5370010f0d67cda0e347edda1f7a006e8d0ab,['Medline'],Correlation between clinical features and magnetic resonance imaging findings in lumbar disc prolapse,Indian journal of orthopaedics,2010

The obtained results show the existence of different phenotypes of common carps at Croatian farms, primarily, morphometric differences. However, the sygnificant diferences of dressing percentage among the populations were not registered (p>0.05). The significant difference between the dressing percentages of scaled and mirror carps was not detected (p>0.05), what leads to the conclusion that the scaliness does not influence dressing percentage significantly. The age and sex also, dit not show significant influence on dressing percentage.

We empirically evaluated the effects of near visually realistic vs. non-realistic stylized appearance of virtual humans on the emotional response of participants in a medical virtual reality system that was designed to educate users in recognizing the signs and symptoms of patient deterioration. In a between-subjects experiment protocol, participants interacted with one of three different appearances of a virtual patient, namely visually realistic, cartoon-shaded and charcoal-sketch like conditions in a mixed reality simulation. Emotional impact were measured via a combination of quantitative objective measures were gathered using skin Electrodermal Activity (EDA) sensors, and quantitative subjective measures such as the Differential Emotion Survey (DES IV), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and Social Presence questionnaire. The emotional states of the participants were analyzed across four distinct time steps during which the medical condition of the virtual patient deteriorated (an emotionally stressful interaction), and were contrasted to a baseline affective state. Objective EDA results showed that in all three conditions, male participants exhibited greater levels of arousal as compared to female participants. We found that negative affect levels were significantly lower in the visually realistic condition, as compared to the stylized appearance conditions. Furthermore, in emotional dimensions of interest-excitement, surprise, anger, fear and guilt participants in all conditions responded similarly. However, in social emotional constructs of shyness, presence, perceived personality, and enjoyment-joy, we found that participants responded differently in the visually realistic condition as compared to the cartoon and sketch conditions. Our study suggests that virtual human appearance can affect not only critical emotional reactions in affective inter-oersonal trainina scenarios. but also users' oerceotions of oersonalitv and social characteristic of the virtual interlocutors.",['http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/TVCG.2016.2518158'],26780808v1,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2a69e806a42bf401017c9c9b6b1c1efb1430c541,"['DBLP', 'Medline']",Effects of Virtual Human Appearance Fidelity on Emotion Contagion in Affective Inter-Personal Simulations,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,2016

The liver is the most common target organ in the metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Synchronous liver metastases may confer a poorer prognosis than metachronous metastases, and genetic alterations and an inflammatory response have also been associated with a poor prognosis in cases of a liver metastasis arising from CRC. However, few studies have examined the relationship between KRAS mutations and inflammatory status in CRC, especially with respect to liver metastases.


METHODS
The effect of the activated mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and another protein involved in inflammation, C-reactive protein, in liver metastases were examined. We aimed to determine the impact of the CRP-specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7553007 in liver metastasis on the CRC-specific survival (CSS) of patients after colorectal liver metastasectomy.


RESULTS
We found no significant differences in genotype distributions and allele frequencies at the CRP SNP rs7553007 between CRC patients with liver metastasis and the control group. CSS rates were low in the subgroup of patients with synchronous metastasis with the A-allele (A/A and A/G) at rs7553007 or mutated KRAS/BRAF in liver metastatic specimens. Furthermore, the CRP SNP rs7553007 (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.101; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.011-1.200; P = 0.027) and KRAS/BRAF mutations (HR = 2.377; 95% CI = 1.293-4.368; P = 0.005) remained predictive for the CSS of CRC patients with synchronous liver metastasis in multivariate analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
Both the CRP SNP rs7553007 and KRAS/BRAF mutations were independent prognostic factors for CRC patients with synchronous liver metastasis.",[],23755178,http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/dc62/41508fe1d75ef247f805654fa250e8005e23.pdf,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/dc6241508fe1d75ef247f805654fa250e8005e23,['Medline'],Prognostic Significance of C-Reactive Protein Polymorphism and KRAS/BRAF in Synchronous Liver Metastasis from Colorectal Cancer,PloS one,2013

In this work, we present several approaches to optimize the analysis of intestinal microbiota with the recently developed Microbiota Array. First, we determined how 16S rDNA-specific PCR amplification influenced bacterial detection and the consistency of measured abundance values. Bacterial detection improved with an increase in the number of PCR amplification cycles, but 25 cycles were sufficient to achieve the maximum possible detection. A PCR-caused deviation in the measured abundance values was also observed. We also developed two mathematical algorithms that aimed to account for a predicted cross-hybridization of 16S rDNA fragments among different species, and to adjust the measured hybridization signal based on the number of 16S rRNA gene copies per species genome. The 16S rRNA gene copy adjustment indicated that the presence of members of the class Clostridia might be overestimated in some 16S rDNA-based studies. Finally, we show that the examination of total community RNA with phylogenetic microarray can provide estimates of the relative metabolic activity of individual community members. Complementary profiling of genomic DNA and total RNA isolated from the same sample presents an opportunity to assess population structure and activity in the same microbial community.",[],21155851v1,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9d086b757124f3a79af27aabbd609780ef206783,['Medline'],Optimizing the analysis of human intestinal microbiota with phylogenetic microarray.,FEMS microbiology ecology,2011

I????????? having a lot of burning when I urinate and wonder if I should be on antibiotics.????????? With a sinking feeling in my stomach, I quickly dialed Sharon????????? number and unfortunately got an answering machine. I apologized for not getting her message sooner, explaining that the clinic was closed for a federal holiday on Thursday, and that Fridays and Mondays were the days that I didn????????? work at the clinic. All of these were true statements, but as I recounted them before Sharon????????? answering machine they sounded pathetic. I didn????????? hear back from Sharon and felt worse. Although I later learned that she????????? obtained appropriate treatment from her university health services, I still felt terrible. If Sharon had been less educated or didn????????? speak English or was homebound, an untreated urinary tract infection could have progressed to pyelonephritis, even sepsis. Even though my voice mail greeting clearly states which days I????????? not in the clinic and that I won????????? be getting messages on those days and provides the phone number required for immediate attention, it is not uncommon to find messages with real urgency when I return to the office several days later. It is at these times that being a part-time physician feels as if I????????? somehow shirking the Hippocratic Oath. I????????? not there for my patients all the time like a physician should. During my ?????????n????????? days, I work furiously like my colleagues, seeing all of my patients, squeezing in anyone who calls or shows up, supervising residents and students, following up ontest results, returningphonecalls, fillingoutmedical forms, writing letters for disability, housing, school, and work. But on my ?????????ff????????? days, I am officially off. I don????????? go to the hospital, don????????? check my voice mail, though I do carry my beeper for emergencies. If my patients need medical attention on those days, they have to be seen in our walk-in clinic, or go to the emergency department if it is after hours or on weekends. When this happens, I feel terribly guilty about being a part-timer, but I sometimes wonder whether this guilt is misplaced. Is there anything inherently wrong with working in medicine part-time? Between 10% and 20% of physicians define themselves as ?????????art-time,????????? and pediatrics leads the pack for specialties conducive to part-time work. Patient trust and satisfaction with part-time physicians appear to be similar to that with full-time physicians. Part-time physicians report less burnout, higher satisfaction, and a greater sense of control than full-time physicians. The small studies that have been done on clinical outcomes suggest that part-time physicians achieve outcomes comparable to those of their full-time counterparts, and might even be more efficient. But, not surprisingly, part-time academic physicians fall behind their full-time colleagues in terms of promotion and tenure. Academic physicians view part-time faculty members as less committed, though they concede that parttimers ought to be considered for promotion and even given extra time, if needed, to achieve tenure. Conventional wisdom has it that most physicians choose part-time work so that they can balance work with family, and that these physicians are women. The statistics largely support this. But should part-time medicine be solely viewed as the hodgepodge mess that is left over when women cut their hours to have children? Perhaps part-time medicine is its own entity. Could the part-time physician be seen as another type of clinician?????????aboring alongside hospitalists, intensivists, pulmonologists, and nephrologists? Unlike most of my part-time colleagues, I did not become a part-time physician as a result of children. My career ?????????hoice????????? came about with more bureaucratic banality????????? New York City budget crisis that caused a hiring freeze just as I was poised to begin my academic career. When the freeze unfroze, there was only a parttime spot available. Working part time had never once crossed my mind when I had envisioned my career, but there it was: a three-day-a-week offer, nothing else. I was single, unemployed, fresh out of residency, with 14 years worth of student loans coming due. I did the only pragmatic thing and snapped it up, hoping that maybe a fulltime position would open up later. What happened next was entirely unplanned and unexpected. With two days available each week, I suddenly had time to devote to my other interests in life?????????nes that had been decisively extirpated by medical training. I began reading literature?????????ot the medical kind?????????nd was finally able to pursue that nagging desire to write down some of the memorable experiences in medical school and residency. I didn????????? plan to become a writer, but having those two days away from medicine allowed me to take writing classes and invest serious energy into this effort.

In this study, the effects of quercetin ingestion on Helicoverpa armigera larvae growth and its sensitivity to lambda-cyhalothrin were assessed. The median lethal concentration (LC50) value of lambda-cyhalothrin to quercetin-fed H. armigera larvae was 2.39-fold higher than the control, suggesting a reduced sensitivity to lambda-cyhalothrin. Piperonyl butoxide (PBO) treatment effectively synergized lambda-cyhalothrin efficacy in quercetin-fed H. armigera larvae with a synergistic ratio of 2.36. Moreover, the growth of H. armigera larvae was inhibited by the quercetin uptake. To understand the reduced sensitivity to lambda-cyhalothrin, we measured the enzymatic activity of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), as well as transcriptional responses of three P450s genes in quercetin-fed H. armigera larvae. We found that cytochrome P450 monooxygenases involved in the observed lambda-cyhalothrin tolerance in quercetin-fed H. armigera. After fed on quercetin for 48???h, 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase (ECOD) activity was significantly elevated in quercetin-fed H. armigera larvae; meanwhile, the expression level of CYP6B6, CYP6B8 and CYP321A1 was up-regulated. In conclusion, P450s played a crucial role in the metabolic adaptation of H. armigera larvae to its host plant????????? secondary metabolites as well as synthetic insecticides. The reduced lambda-cyhalothrin sensitivity in quercetin-fed H. armigera larvae suggested that previous exposure to the host plant-derived quercetin is likely to compromise the efficacy of pyrethroid insecticides.",[],,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4951368990c174aba5bd0fa566832fc5d0fc614d,[],Uptake of quercetin reduces larval sensitivity to lambda-cyhalothrin in Helicoverpa armigera,Journal of Pest Science,2017

To evaluate the anti-apoptotic effect of banhasasim-tang (BHSST) on chronic acid reflux esophagitis (CARE) using a rat model.


METHODS
A surgically-induced CARE model was established in Sprague-Dawley rats. The modeled rats were divided into a treatment group or untreated group, and given BHSST (1 g/kg body weight per day) or water, respectively, for 15 consecutive days (n = 7 each group). Changes in expression of proteins related to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and apoptosis were assessed by western blotting. Changes in esophageal pathology were analyzed by gross and histological examinations.


RESULTS
The CARE exposure modeled rats showed increased levels of the NADPH oxidase subunit, NOX4 and p47phox in the esophagus. The BHSST treatment completely resolved these CARE-related increases. The CARE rats also showed markers of cytokine stress, including elevated levels of TNF-??? and reactive oxygen species as well as of the consequent increase in JNK activation, and subsequent decrease in pro-survival gene expression, such as of Bcl-2. BHSST treatment resolved the CARE-related changes. BHSST also exerted an anti-apoptotic effect, as evidenced by altered expression of the apoptosis-related genes for bax, cytochrome c, and caspase 3. Finally, the BHSST treatment markedly ameliorated the CARE-related esophageal mucosal ulcerations.


CONCLUSION
In the rat model of CARE, BHSST can suppress development of esophageal mucosal ulceration via regulation of reactive oxygen species-dependent apoptosis.",[],28740353v1,http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e15d/8875b95895634eeb0fc71d0c957d50ab152a.pdf,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e15d8875b95895634eeb0fc71d0c957d50ab152a,['Medline'],Anti-apoptotic effect of banhasasim-tang on chronic acid reflux esophagitis,World journal of gastroenterology,2017

Histological data revealed that local hypothermia significantly reduced infarct volumes and glial hypertrophic activation.

Poor self-rated health has been associated with poorer objective health outcomes across a range of conditions including stroke. Identification of factors associated with poor self-rated health in stroke survivors has received little attention compared to that in other older individuals. This study identifies determinants of self-rated health in older individuals with or without a history of stroke participating in the population-representative MRC Cognitive Function and Aging Study (MRC CFAS).


METHODS
The MRC CFAS is a multicentred longitudinal survey of a population representative sample of people in their 65th year and older at baseline. Baseline interview included questions about functional disability, psychiatric history, independent living status, social interactions, and cognitive function. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine associations between demographic, physical, cognitive, psychological and social factors with poor self-rated health among those with and without stroke.


RESULTS
After excluding those with impaired cognitive function, 776 individuals out of 11,957 reported a stroke. Factors associated with self-rated health were similar between those with or without a stroke in older individuals. Poorer self-rated health in those who had suffered a stroke was associated predominantly with the presence of comorbidity with diabetes (OR 3.5; 95% CI 1.5-8.1) and not ""getting out and about"" (OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.7-4.1) even after adjustment for disability levels and for depression. In those without a stroke the most important determinants were disability (OR 3.9; 95% CI 3.2-4.8) and not ""getting out and about"" (OR 2.9; 95% CI 2.5-3.3). The presence of disability was less strongly associated with poor self-rated health in those with a history of stroke than those without due to a substantially higher reporting of poor self-rated health in the non-disabled stroke group than the non-disabled stroke-free group, while those with disabilities reported poor self-rated health irrespective of stroke status.


CONCLUSIONS
Self-rated health is determined by a range of psychological and social factors in addition to disability in older patients with stroke. Addressing social integration and mobility out of the home is an important element of rehabilitation for older people with stroke as well as those without.",[],23968389,http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/187a/74a145a3eefe20626fda3d804048b8456e70.pdf,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/187a74a145a3eefe20626fda3d804048b8456e70,['Medline'],What determines the self-rated health of older individuals with stroke compared to other older individuals?

However, its value is not predicted by the theory and has to be determined experimentally. The success of perturbative QCD (pQCD) lies on precise and consistent determinations of the coupling from many diverse phenomena such as ?????? decays, event shapes, Z decays, etc. At ZEUS, many precise determinations of ???s have been performed from a variety of measurements based on jet observables and on structure functions. The procedure to determine ???s from jet observables used by ZEUS is based on the ???s dependence of the pQCD calculations and takes into account the correlation with the proton parton distribution functions (PDFs). The method consists of performing next-to-leadingorder (NLO) calculations using sets of PDFs for which different values of ???s(MZ) were assumed in the fits. A parameterisation of the ???s(MZ) dependence of the theory for the given observable is obtained. Finally, a value for ???s(MZ) is extracted from the measured cross section using such parameterisation. This procedure handles correctly the complete ???sdependence of the NLO calculations (the explicit dependence in the partonic cross section and the implicit dependence from the PDFs) in the fit, while preserving the correlation between ???s and the PDFs.",['http://arxiv.org/pdf/0708.0796v1.pdf'],,http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5f72/9a273e2cbceabc2ccf074b7f5fbb5fdb5381.pdf,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5f729a273e2cbceabc2ccf074b7f5fbb5fdb5381,[],Zeus ??????,,2008

Diffusive Gradients in Thin Films (DGT) devices can measure Mg availability in situ. This work shows that Mg accumulation in water largely increases when ionic strength (I) decreases. This phenomenon can be explained from (i) the increase of both the association equilibrium (K) and rate (ka,R) constants for the reaction between Mg cations and resin sites, and (ii) the growing contribution of the partitioning of Mg cations at the resin-gel interface, as I decreases. Two theoretical models that take into account electrical interactions among Mg cations, background electrolyte, and resin sites can successfully be used to determine ka,R and K at each I. Both models yield similar ka,R values, which fulfill an expression for the kinetic salt effect. For freshwater (with a typical salinity of 10 mM and circumneutral pH), the binding of Mg is so fast and strong that the simplest perfect-sink DGT expression can be helpful to predict (overestimation lower than 5%) the accumulation in solutions with Mg concentrations up to 1 mM whenever the deployment time is below 9 h.

Similar pressures face the teaching of pharmacology in other countries and the situation, discussed here by Clive Page, Morley Sutter and Michael Walker, clearly has implications for academic pharmacology and the pharmaceutical industry. It is intended that the following article will stimulate both dialogue and positive action towards redressing this important problem.",[],8140653v1,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6adccaf01b75cf1462bc10d7dde0d8936ea5f5c1,['Medline'],"Wither, whether and whither pharmacology.",Trends in pharmacological sciences,1994

In this study, we asked whether AF may in addition radiosensitize tumor cells by targeting thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), a critical enzyme in the antioxidant defense system operating through the reductive protein thioredoxin. Our principal findings in murine 4T1 and EMT6 tumor cells are that AF at 3-10 ???M is a potent radiosensitizer in vitro, and that at least two mechanisms are involved in TrxR-mediated radiosensitization. The first one is linked to an oxidative stress, as scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by N-acetyl cysteine counteracted radiosensitization. We also observed a decrease in mitochondrial oxygen consumption with spared oxygen acting as a radiosensitizer under hypoxic conditions. Overall, radiosensitization was accompanied by ROS overproduction, mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage and apoptosis, a common mechanism underlying both cytotoxic and antitumor effects of AF. In tumor-bearing mice, a simultaneous disruption of the thioredoxin and glutathione systems by the combination of AF and buthionine sulfoximine was shown to significantly improve tumor radioresponse. In conclusion, our findings illuminate TrxR in cancer cells as an exploitable radiobiological target and warrant further validation of AF in combination with radiotherapy.",['http://www.oncotarget.com/index.php?journal=oncotarget&op=download&page=article&path%5B%5D=16113&path%5B%5D=51502'],28415723,http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e7b0/ba67cbf081e7e6058660591b10c467fae208.pdf,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e7b0ba67cbf081e7e6058660591b10c467fae208,['Medline'],Auranofin radiosensitizes tumor cells through targeting thioredoxin reductase and resulting overproduction of reactive oxygen species,Oncotarget,2017

In Drosophila mediopunctata this trait has a variable expression due to Y-linked suppressors of sex-ratio expression, among other factors. There are tow types of Y chromosomes (suppressor and nonsuppressor) and two types of SR chromosomes (suppressible and unsuppressible). Sex-ratio expression is suppressed in males with the SRsuppressible/Ysuppressor genotype, whereas the remaining three genotypes produce female biased progenies. Now we have found that approximately 10-20% of the Y chromosomes from two natural populations 1500 km apart are suppressors of sex-ratio expression. Preliminary estimates indicate that Ysuppressor has a meiotic drive advantage of 6% over Ynonsuppressor. This Y polymorphism for a nonneutral trait is unexpected under current population genetics theory. We propose that this polymorphism is stabilized by an equilibrium between meiotic drive and natural selection, resulting from interactions in the population dynamics of X and Y alleles. Numerical simulations showed that this mechanism may stabilize nonneutral Y polymorphisms such as we have found in D. mediopunctata.",[],9215895v1,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ee4c1fdb72a00ee4bf1f0fadf34e2eec8b701198,['Medline'],Polymorphism for Y-linked suppressors of sex-ratio in two natural populations of Drosophila mediopunctata.,Genetics,1997

In this scheduling technique, the packets are transferred erratically across the distributed network. The convey of packets randomly across network cases the anonymous users to access the packets. The data packets should be transferred in authorized path to multiple recipients. The main objective of this research work is to transfer packets to the destination through optimized path. It can be achieved using the assorted metaheuristic techniques including genetic algorithm, simulated annealing, honey bee algorithm and many others. We have used Ant Colony Optimization for solving the optimization problem. An authorized and novel technique is proposed to overcome these problems. In the classical or traditional system, they are mainly concentrated on transferring packets between the source and destination and also they are concentrated when the source and destination are under movement, nowadays the mobile devices plays major role in network topology. Multicasting was clearly proved in the classical system by transferring packets from one source to many destinations on a single time. The proposed system is designed to overcome various problems, arises during the multicast packet transfer to the mobile nodes. The proposed system provides an optimized route to the various destinations using the ant algorithm as we discussed above, with the help of this path the packets are transferred to the various destinations. In this multicast scheduling technique, various problems arising during the routing has been overcome by using Ant algorithm whereby the proposed novel technique provides solution for routing for nodes which are static and nodes under movement.
